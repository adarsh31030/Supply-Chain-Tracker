# Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Description

The Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based solution built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. This decentralized application enables transparent and immutable tracking of products throughout their entire supply chain journey, from manufacturing to final delivery. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures data integrity, prevents tampering, and provides real-time visibility into product movement and status updates.

The smart contract allows authorized participants in the supply chain to create products, update their locations and status, and maintain a complete historical record of all transactions and movements. This creates an auditable trail that enhances trust, accountability, and efficiency in supply chain management.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize supply chain management by creating a transparent, secure, and decentralized ecosystem where every stakeholder can verify product authenticity, track movement history, and ensure accountability at every step. We aim to eliminate fraud, reduce counterfeiting, increase consumer confidence, and enable businesses to optimize their supply chain operations through real-time data and historical insights.

By democratizing access to supply chain information, we envision a future where consumers can make informed decisions, businesses can prove their sustainability claims, and regulatory compliance becomes automated and verifiable.
